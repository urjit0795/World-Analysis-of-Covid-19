# World-Analysis-of-Covid-19
For the Big Data Project, I addressed the 
problem for World Analyses of Covid 19. I wanted 
to address questions on How Covid 19 impacted the 
world, which countries had the highest cases and 
highest deaths, which countries had the highest 
vaccination count, and did vaccination decrease the 
active cases and deaths. 

Phase 1: Data Cleaning, Exploration, Dataset 
Analysis for World Vaccination Data. 
Visualizations for Vaccination 
Statistics concerning the world and 
reporting the best-vaccinated 
country.

Phase 2: Data Cleaning, Exploration, Dataset 
Analysis for World Analysis using 
PySpark. Visualizations for total 
deaths, confirmed, and new cases

Phase 3: Data Exploration and Analysis for 
India Dataset, Building Linear 
Regression using PySpark and LSTM 
Model for prediction and 
forecasting.
